# House Price Prediction in Chicago
This project was developed as part of my Professional Certificate program in Data Science at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. The objective was to design a regression model for the real estate industry to predict house prices in the city of Chicago.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to accurately predict house prices using machine learning techniques. This can help stakeholders in the real estate market, such as buyers, sellers, and investors, make informed decisions. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
